Did you wrap the expression in double quotes, like you should have?

   sed "s' /'/'g" infile >outfile

You could also use a different delimiter, if you like:

   sed "s| /|/|g" infile >outfile

If you still don't get any visible results, there are some less
probable explanations. You could have true tabs (0x09) instead of
spaces in the input file; so you could be trying to replace spaces
when you should be trying to replace a tab (not likely, but it can
happen). The 0x09 is programmer's notation for 9 hexadecimal.

The input file might have a pseudo-space: 0xFF looks just like a
space from a DOS prompt. From a DOS or a CMD window, it is entered
by typing ALT-255 from the numeric keypad. When you send the file
to the DOS or CMD screen with the TYPE or MORE commands, the space
(0x20) and the pseudo-space (0xFF) appear to be identical. The
only way to tell them apart is with a program that can dump to
hex or octal, or you can use sed's "l" (lower-case L) command:

   sed -n l infile

The value of FF in hex is 377 in octal, so you should see a "\377"
in sed's output if there are any 0xFF characters hiding in the file.
This is probably more than you needed to know, but I thought I'd
cover all the bases this time.
